        Tottenham Hotspur will be returning to Japan for the first time in 33 years this summer.
        The Club will play reigning J1 League champions Vissel Kobe at the Japan National Stadium on Saturday 27 July as part of our preparations for the 2024/25 season.
        Prior to this, the team will also participate in an Open Training session, also at the Japan National Stadium, on Friday 26 July from 5pm.

        The last visit came in 1991 after having won the FA Cup when we took part in the Kirin Cup.
        Tickets for the match against Vissel Kobe and for the Open Training session are on now on general sale.
